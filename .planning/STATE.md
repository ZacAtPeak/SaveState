# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-07)

**Core value:** Any TTRPG group can open SaveState, pick or import their game system, and immediately have a properly structured wiki, character sheet, and encounter tracker — no hardcoded D&D assumptions.
**Current focus:** Phase 06 — service-layer-d-d-5e-asset

## Current Position

Phase: 06 (service-layer-d-d-5e-asset) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 2
Status: Executing Phase 06
Last activity: 2026-05-08 -- Phase 06 execution started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Research identified ChangeNotifierProxyProvider rewire (Phase 6) as highest regression risk — test WikiProvider round-trip before and after
- [Roadmap]: WikiMigrationRunner must run before WikiPageType enum deletion — Phase 8 order is migration first, then delete
- [Roadmap]: Use Selector not Consumer at all GameModelService downstream widgets to prevent cascade rebuilds on system switch
- [Roadmap]: schemaVersion required in every GameModel JSON from Phase 5 first commit — cannot be retrofitted

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Initiative formula grammar: define whether CoC DEX-rank sort is a special token or an isRolled: false flag in rulesConfig — must resolve in Phase 5 or 6 before Phase 9 encounter tracker work
- file_picker dependency must be added to apps only (not core) when implementing Phase 10 import
